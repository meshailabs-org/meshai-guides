# MeshAI Guides

Welcome to the MeshAI Guides repository! This collection provides comprehensive documentation and tutorials for building, deploying, and managing AI agents with the MeshAI platform.

## 📚 What is MeshAI?

MeshAI is a universal orchestration platform for autonomous AI agents that enables seamless communication and collaboration between agents built on different frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and more). Think of it as the interoperability layer that allows your AI agents to work together, regardless of their underlying technology.
